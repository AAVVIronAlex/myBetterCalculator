Alex V's Better Calculator
This project was started because of @sergey4588's "calculator" that could only calculate the sum of 2 numbers.
In this repo you can find all the versions that work and also a single version that does not. The C++ version has been fixed and is now working.
This program will later evolve into a calculator that helps people solve their problems step by step. Like the mobile program called PhotoMath.
