Alex V's Better Calculator

This project was started because of @sergey4588's "calculator" that could only calculate the sum of 2 numbers. Hosting both a C++ and a Python version, which I tried to create as similar as possible (please report the differences if you find any).

In this repo (in the `older versions` folder) you can find all the versions that work and also a single version that does not. The updates of the program, however, are not being backed up into the `older versions` folder anymore, for example, the C++ version has never been backed up. Please refer to the changelog on this page for more information on the changes. The C++ version has been fixed and is now working.

This program will later evolve into a calculator that helps people solve their problems step by step. Like the mobile program called PhotoMath, but based on the command line.
